## Quietude Syntax

> _Quietude_ is a syntax theme with soft yet contrasted colours and subtle animations, providing a distraction-free environment perfect for focus and thoughtfulness.

___Quietude___ is based on [One Dark Syntax](https://atom.io/themes/one-dark-syntax) and is meant to be paired with [One Dark UI](https://atom.io/themes/one-dark-ui).

It has been fully adapted to support all the same languages as One Dark and the syntax has been revamped for easier customisation. Testing was done primarily on HTML, CSS (and pre-processors), PHP, JavaScript and C#.

The font used in the screenshots is [mononoki](http://madmalik.github.io/mononoki/) (which I highly recommend). The code itself is freely adapted from [Atom's homepage](https://atom.io/), the [WordPress loop](https://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop) and the [jQuery source](https://jquery.com/).
